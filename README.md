**What I learned:** Can treat a 2D matrix as a 1D sorted array if the last element of each row is less than the first of the next.  
**Insight:** Binary search could be used via index mapping ‚Äî initially missed this.  
**Mistake made:** Did brute-force row-wise search. Realized afterward this was inefficient ‚Äî need to refactor with binary search.  
**Time Complexity:** O(m √ó n) (brute-force)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## üîπ Problem 3: Flood Fill  
**Link:** [LeetCode - Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)  
**What I learned:** Classic DFS problem; important to check if already visited or the color doesn't match.  
**Insight:** If the new color is the same as the old, avoid infinite recursion by early return.  
**Mistake made:** Forgot to handle base case for color equality ‚Äî caused TLE initially. Fixed with a conditional check.  
**Time Complexity:** O(m √ó n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(m √ó n) (due to recursion stack)

---

## üîÅ Reflection

This day was all about grid traversal and boundary control.  
Challenging but essential ‚Äî especially the debugging in recursive cases like flood fill.

---

# üíØ 100 Days Coding Challenge ‚Äî Day 9 Complete üöÄ

Another day pushing through!  
This challenge isn't just about solving problems ‚Äî it's about understanding patterns, handling failures, and building momentum. Day 9 was tough ‚Äî from combinatorics to prefix logic and array analysis.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) ‚Äî after modifying the list in-place

---

## üß© Problem 2: Remove N-th Node from End of List  
**Link:** [LeetCode - Remove N-th Node from End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)  
**What I learned:** Two-pointer technique ‚Äî maintaining a fixed gap.

## How to Run The Code

- Each problem is implemented in **C++** inside the `Day1` folder.  
- Files named clearly by problem, e.g., `subArraySumEqualsK.cpp`, `findMissingElement.cpp`, `replaceElementsWithGreatestRightSide.cpp`.

To compile and run a solution:

```bash
g++ Day1/SubarraySumEqualsK.cpp -o subarraysum
./subarraysum
```

Or try to copy the code and run in Online C++ Compiler
